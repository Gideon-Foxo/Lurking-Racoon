# Lurking Racoon Version 2

Version 2 was a full rewrite from [version 1](https://github.com/Gideon-foxo/Lurking-Racoon-version-1) with many improvements. The biggest changes where commands being moved to if statements rather then their own event listeners and a config file. Version  2 also had much more commands and join and leave logs as well as a basic gatekeeper. Auttaja was unstable and was constantly taking over 10 minuets  to respond for days and no help from the support team.

# About the Bot

Lurking Racoon was a private bot made for my server at the time to help fill in the needs and do other custom things that public bots couldn't really do. The whole bot was made with one goal in mind, to ban people who said the n word. This is the first rewrite  of the project of which there would be 2 total.
