# Lurking Racoon Version 1

Version 1 of Lurking Racoon was where it all started for me, my very first coding project and Discord bot. As to be expected with out any real coding education or a will to really learn coding at the time this is a hot mess. But given the fact that I had no real coding experience and this was my very first time can you really expect anything more? To see the other later version of bot please use the branches.

# About the Bot

Lurking Racoon was a private bot made for my server at the time to help fill in the needs and do other custom things that public bots couldn't really do. The whole bot was made with one goal in mind, to ban people who said the n word. Only I kept adding other things to it and ultmitly made a full rewrite in [version 2](). Given that the bot only ran on 1 small ish server it did its job... even if it did throw memory leak errors. 

This repo only exists as a archive of my starting point for coding and its not intended for you to use any matter. **Please do not attempt to use or run this**.
