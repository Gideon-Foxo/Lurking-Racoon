# Lurking Racoon Version 3

Version 3 was a full rewrite from [version 2](https://github.com/Gideon-foxo/Lurking-Racoon-version-3) changing from a single file format to a command per file format. This hugely made development of new commands and features possible. The biggest new thing here was mod commands! As well as a bunch of silly commands. This would be the last production version. A version 4 was started but never was finished to the point of bring run before it was scrapped and I left the server as a whole and gave ownership of the bot to someone else.

# About the Bot

Lurking Racoon was a private bot made for my server at the time to help fill in the needs and do other custom things that public bots couldn't really do. The whole bot was made with one goal in mind, to ban people who said the n word. This is the second and last rewrite of the project of which there would be 2 total.
